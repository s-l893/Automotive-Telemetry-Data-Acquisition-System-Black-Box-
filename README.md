Automotive Black Box V1.0
High-Performance Telematics Logger for 9th Gen Honda Accord
A custom embedded system designed to capture and log real-time vehicle telemetry including CAN bus data (RPM, Throttle), high-precision GPS, and 6-axis IMU G-forces. Built on the STM32 platform, this system is optimized for high-speed data acquisition and persistent storage for performance analysis.

System Architecture
The system utilizes the STM32 HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) to manage four concurrent communication protocols:
•	CAN Bus (500 kbps): Decodes proprietary Honda F-CAN messages (ID 0x158) to extract engine RPM and vehicle state.
•	I2C: High-speed sensor polling for G-force calculation with localized offsets for calibration.
•	UART: Asynchronous parsing of NMEA strings from GPS satellites to achieve 6-decimal place coordinate precision.
•	SPI: Real-time data logging to a CSV format at 2Hz (500ms intervals).

Installation & Safety
[!CAUTION]
This device interfaces directly with the vehicle's OBD-II port. Ensure a 5A fast-acting fuse is installed on the ground line to protect vehicle ECUs from potential short circuits.
1.	Clone this repository.
2.	Open in STM32CubeIDE.
3.	Build and Flash to Nucleo-F446RE.
4.	Connect to vehicle OBD-II (Pins 6, 14, and GND).
