Automotive Black Box V1.0 High-Performance Telematics Logger for 9th Gen Honda Accord A custom embedded system designed to capture and log real-time vehicle telemetry including CAN bus data (RPM, Throttle), high-precision GPS, and 6-axis IMU G-forces. Built on the STM32 platform, this system is optimized for high-speed data acquisition and persistent storage for performance analysis.

Technical Specifications • Microcontroller: STM32F446RE (ARM Cortex-M4). • Clock Speed: Overclocked to 180 MHz for minimized processing latency. • Storage: microSD via SPI (FATFS). • Display: SSD1306 128x64 OLED via I2C. • Sensors: * IMU: MPU6050 (Accelerometer/Gyroscope). o GPS: NEO-6M Module (UART). • Vehicle Interface: SN65HVD230 CAN Transceiver.

System Architecture The system utilizes the STM32 HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) to manage four concurrent communication protocols: • CAN Bus (500 kbps): Decodes proprietary Honda F-CAN messages (ID 0x158) to extract engine RPM and vehicle state. • I2C: High-speed sensor polling for G-force calculation with localized offsets for calibration. • UART: Asynchronous parsing of NMEA strings from GPS satellites to achieve 6-decimal place coordinate precision. • SPI: Real-time data logging to a CSV format at 2Hz (500ms intervals).

Data Format Logs are stored in the root directory with a timestamped filename (MMDDHHMM.csv) generated by the onboard RTC. Time, Ax, Ay, Az, Lat, Lon, Spd, RPM, Throttle, VTEC (Tailored for Honda/Acura).

Installation & Safety [!CAUTION] This device interfaces directly with the vehicle's OBD-II port. Ensure a 1A fast-acting fuse is installed on the ground line to protect vehicle ECUs from potential short circuits.
